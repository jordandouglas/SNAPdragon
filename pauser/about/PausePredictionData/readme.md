## Posterior distribution for "Approximate Bayesian computation of transcriptional pausing mechanisms."




trainingSet.fasta is the 50 gene test set (with known pause sites specified, as measured by Larson et al. 2014, URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1251871 )

testSet.fasta is the 2403 gene test set (with known pause sites specified, as measured by Larson et al. 2014, URL: https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1251871 )

pausing_session.xml is the SimPol session used to train the kinetic model classifier (50 training genes are contained within the file)

model_number_guide.pdf is a visual guide for the 128 models specified in pausing_session.xml

pausing_posterior.log is the posterior distribution obtained from training the kinetic model classifier on the training set
